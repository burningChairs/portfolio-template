    <h1>Ann Jordan's CS Project Portfolio</h1>      
    <p id="intro">I will be going to Santa Barbara city college next year as a Freshman in College. In the four years of my highschool career I attended Santa Barbara Senior High School and was in two academies, two sports, and multiple clubs. One of the academies I had participated in was the Computer Science Acadamy, where I originally got into coding. Now that Ill be going into city college to major in Biology, however I plan on continuing my computer science journey with their computer science lab. I am very interested in the software of technology and love the idea and technology of quantum computing (I was in an introduction to quantum computing course with MIT and stanford - Qubit X Qubit: Google & IBM Sponsored.) I have also been very interested in art for most of my life (the other acadamy I attended is VADA - Visual Arts + Design Acadamy) I hope to be able to encourperate my art into my programming.</p>
