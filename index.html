    <h1>Ann's CS Project Portfolio</h1>      
    <p>I will be going to middle college at Santa Barbara city college next year as a junior in highschool. The first two years of my highschool career I attended Santa Barbara Senior High School and was in two acadamies. One of these acadamies being the Computer Science Acadamy, where I originally got into coding. Now that Ill be going into middle college I plan on continuing my computer science journey with their computer science lab and building. I am very interested in the software of technology and have recently getten into quantum computing (I was in an introduction to quantum computing course with MIT and stanford.) I have also been very interested in art for most of my life (the other acadamy I am in is VADA - Visual Arts and Design Acadamy) I hope to be able to encourperate my art into my computer science career.</p>
    <p>Computer science classes I've takin so far; Introduction to Computer Science, Computational Art, Introduction to Quantum Computing, AP Computer Science</p>

        <p>Create Ur Character or "Cuc final project (december project)" is a dress up game with original character and clothing designs by Ann Jordan and Alisa Alyakrinsky. Me and Alisa have created an interactive and creative game using JavaScript. We made this project in our Intoduction to Computer Science class as Freshman, for our final project.</p>

        <p>Bhaddie Final Project or "Ann & Elly Final Bhaddie Project" is another dress up game, based off of the game MovieStarPlanet (a game that my partner in this project used to pley when she was younger. This project was made by me (Ann Jordan) and Elly Quevas. We created this game in JavaScript for our AP Computer Science class (I was a Sophmore and she was a Senior) for our final project.</p>
